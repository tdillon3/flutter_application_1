# Overview

As a software engineer constantly pursuing advancements in my skillset, I initiated this project to deepen my understanding of Flutter and Dart. The endeavor is not just a coding exercise but a step towards mastering mobile app development. This app is a simple, user-friendly flashcard application designed to aid learning and memorization. Users can effortlessly create flashcards with a question on one side and an answer on the other. It is intuitive and straightforward, allowing for quick flashcard creation and review.

The purpose behind developing this app is to explore the intricate details of Flutter and Dart and to provide an efficient and effective learning tool for users who want to memorize information quickly. It's a manifestation of my desire to create applications that are not only functional but also contribute to the learning process.

# Development Environment

This app is developed using Flutter, a popular open-source framework for creating natively compiled applications from a single code base. Flutter is known for its fast development, expressive UI, and native performance. Dart, a concise, and powerful language developed by Google, is used as the programming language for building the app.

VSCode served as the chosen IDE, facilitating a smooth and efficient development process with its extensive range of tools and extensions. Dart and Flutter extensions for VSCode were particularly useful, allowing for enhanced productivity and ease of coding.
